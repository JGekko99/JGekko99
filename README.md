Hi, I’m Jacopo Radace (@JGekko99) 👋 – a passionate Fintech enthusiast and emerging leader at the intersection of technology and finance. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Economics and Business Administration at LIUC 🎓, specializing in Banking, Markets, and Corporate Finance with a Fintech orientation.

My journey includes hands-on experiences in financial analysis and IT from internships and job shadowing at Bloomberg, Bene Assicurazioni, and ABL Soluzioni Informatiche 💼. I’m skilled in Python, MATLAB, R, and C++ 💻, and I love leveraging digital transformation to innovate within private banking and wealth management 🚀.

Driven by a deep curiosity for emerging technologies and a commitment to strategic, data-driven financial solutions, I thrive in collaborative environments that challenge conventional thinking and push the boundaries of innovation 🔍🤝.

I’m always looking to collaborate on projects that blend tech with finance to create real impact 💡. Feel free to reach out by dropping a DM – let’s shape the future of finance together! ✨
